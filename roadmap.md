These are all ideas I have that may or may not make it into the final product.

### Stunned Status Effect

Prevents actions, but will be hard to balance

### Allies

Summon little dudes or recruit them along the way to help you

### NPCs

Requires complex dialogue scripting and more world interaction, to give items and stuff.

### Spikes

Deal damage when attacked

### Spell Tags

Enemies and armor can have resistance to certain spell tags, lowering their effectiveness. Equipment can have affinity/synergy with spell tags, boosting their effectiveness.
