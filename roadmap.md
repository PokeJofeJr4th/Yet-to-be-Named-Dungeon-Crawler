These are all ideas I have that may or may not make it into the final product.

### Templates

Easily create enemies with slight variations without duplicating lots of data. Probably only worth it once enemies get more complex

### Stunned Status Effect

Prevents actions, but will be hard to balance

### Allies

Summon little dudes or recruit them along the way to help you

### NPCs

Requires complex dialogue scripting and more world interaction, to give items and stuff.

### Spikes

Deal damage when attacked

### More Equipment Abilities

Allow equipment to cast spells when you attack (weapons) or when you are attacked (armor). They'll use you or the enemy as the target if one needs to be selected.

### Spell Tags

Enemies and armor can have resistance to certain spell tags, lowering their effectiveness. Equipment can have affinity/synergy with spell tags, boosting their effectiveness.
